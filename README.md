# I. Initiative
A program will be created to read and write calender entires from a text file. 


# II. Epics and User Stories
**Epics**


The program will be able to:

- Display all calendar entries in a readable format
- Write new entries to a calendar (.txt) file
- Edit existing entries in the file


**Non-Functional Requirements**
- Format output to look more like a traditional calendar
- Delete a selected entry
- An invalid input asks for the user to try again 

**User Stories**


- As a user, I would like to write entires into the calender
- As a user, I would like to edit existing entries in the file
- As a user, I would like to see my calendar in a nice readable format
- As a user, I would like to delete a selected entry 
- As a user, I would like to be asked again if I enter an invalid response

How We Addressed The Requirements


A plan was set to complete all the requirements that needed to be done, then all the requirements that made the program look better i.e the non-functional requirements

# III. Genre
Utility program on a command line 

# IV. Technical Details

Programming Language/Enviroment

Python IDLE 3.7


Programming Challenges

- The main challenge was integrating the text file with the code
- Another challenge was manipulating the text file, research was done and showed that arrays needed to be used 

 

Constructing And Implementing My Code
Think of this as the method. How will you go about building your program?

Firstly, the user needs to see the existing entries, as this is the easiest part of the program this is a good place to start. Then editing an entry will be worked on followed by adding new entries. Lastly, the non-functional requirements can be worked on, for example allowing the user to completely get rid of entry.
